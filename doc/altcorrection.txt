z: altitude in meters
p: pressure in pascals
slp: sea level pressure, or ground pressure

z = 44330 * (1.0 - p / slp)^0.1903 // where p and slp are in Pascals

ground: z_g = 0 by definition
0 = 44330 * (1.0 - p_g / slp)^0.1903
p_g = slp

vehicle: z_v is unknown, slp changes with time, but can be measured with p_g

Corrected vehicle altitude:
z_v = 44330 * (1.0 - p_v / p_g)^0.1903

double zv = 44330 * pow((1.0 - pv() / pg(), 0.1903);
